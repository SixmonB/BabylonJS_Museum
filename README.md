# BabylonJS_Museum

This project was created for a BabylonJS university course. The goal was to learn about WebGL with a typical Virtual Museum project. I developed it alongside a classmate in GitLab and I can update the final code here.

To launch it, I normally run a Live Server from the VSCode extension instead of creating the server myself.

The scene code is in the file \BabylonJS_Museum\js\fabrique.js
